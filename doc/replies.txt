We added two sentences commenting the meaning of this parameter and how the
value of 20 was chosen.

All the experiments show the result of the  centroid algorithm computed by
algorithm "CentroidCombination".  We have clarified this on the text.

For each input sequence, we show the first frame and the average of all the
frames.  We think that these two images are enough to give an idea of the
amplitude of the deformations.  The rest of the frames look similar to the
first one, but with the deformations at a different place.  Thus, we did not
follow the suggestion of the reviewer here.  Please, let us know if this is a
problem.  In any case, the entire sequences can be downloaded from the online
demo.

Thanks for this suggestion.  We have added a comment at the end of Section 4
regarding the influence of the number of frames.  The reader can try the
influence of the number of input frames on the online demo.

In fact, the median is also described (Weiszfeld algorithm).

Since this code was not used, we opted instead for removing the unused
functions from the "combine" program.  Now there is no unused nor undocumented
code on the program.


> The copyright/license information are missed in all files.

We have added copyright and license information on all files.


> The README information are incomplete, see IPOL guideline.

We have added the missing information to the README file (license, copyright,
authors and a reference to the article).


> Doxygen documentations are missed.

According to current IPOL guidelines, Doxygen is *recommended* but not
*obligatory*.  Since we do not like Doxygen-style documentation, we have opted
to include regular comments to the functions instead.

This problem was due to an error in the README file.  In fact, the provided
example frames have extension ".jpg" and not ".png".  Thus, copy-pasting the
example in the README file directly does not work.  We have updated the README
file so that it uses the same extension as the provided files.

----------

We have added the requested references (not all of them from IPOL).

Actually, there are no "boundary effects" to be taken into account.  We have
changhed this sentence to "Far from the boundary of the image domain", to make
this clear.

Thanks for pointing this.  Now all the subroutines are referenced in the text,
and their correspondence to each formula is explicit.

We have clarified the text around formula (4) to explain that the Weiszfeld
vector median is used instead of the mean.
